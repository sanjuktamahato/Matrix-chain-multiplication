# Matrix-chain-multiplication
Matrix Chain Multiplication is an optimization problem that determines the most efficient way to multiply a sequence of matrices. It uses dynamic programming to minimize the total number of scalar multiplications by finding the best order of parenthesis placement, without changing the result of the product.
